# GESTURE-CONTROLLED-3D-OBJECT
This project demonstrates a real-time hand gesture controlled 3D cube using computer vision techniques. MediaPipe is used for accurate hand landmark detection, while OpenGL and Pygame render a colored 3D cube. The cube rotates along X, Y, and Z axes based on hand movement, enabling intuitive and touchless 3D interaction.
